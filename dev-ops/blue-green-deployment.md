# üöÄ Blue-Green Deployment for Production: Complete Guide + Interview Preparation

## üéØ Objective

To implement **Blue-Green Deployment** using **Kubernetes** and **Istio** in a **production-ready microservices
environment**, with an emphasis on **zero downtime**, **canary testing**, **DB schema management**, **rollback
capabilities**, and **observability**.

## ‚úÖ What is Blue-Green Deployment?

- **Blue-Green Deployment** is a strategy where you maintain two **production environments**: **Blue** (current version)
  and **Green** (new version).
- Initially, all traffic goes to Blue. Once Green is fully deployed and verified, traffic is switched to Green. Blue
  remains as a backup in case of failure.
- This ensures **zero downtime** and allows for **instant rollback** to Blue.

---

## ‚úÖ Real-world Production Workflow

1. **Blue Environment (v1)** runs the current stable version, serving 100% of traffic.
2. Deploy **Green Environment (v2)** with the new version of your application.
3. **Health checks** and **automated tests** are run in the Green environment.
4. Use **canary traffic** routing to test Green with a small subset of traffic.
5. If Green performs well, **shift 100% traffic** to Green.
6. Optionally, keep Blue alive for easy rollback, or delete it after a successful Green deployment.
7. If Green fails at any point, switch traffic back to Blue instantly.

## üóÇÔ∏è Kubernetes Deployment (with Probes, Resources, and Scaling)

### `blue-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: myorg/myapp:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 10
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "250m"
              memory: "512Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"
              memory: "1Gi"
````

---

### `green-deployment.yaml`

> **Same as Blue** with a new image: `image: myorg/myapp:v2` and `version: green`.

---

## üîÄ Service + Istio Routing

### `service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

---

### `destination-rule.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-app-dr
spec:
  host: my-app-service
  subsets:
    - name: blue
      labels:
        version: blue
    - name: green
      labels:
        version: green
```

---

### `virtual-service.yaml` (initial - Blue only)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-app-vs
spec:
  hosts:
    - "*"
  gateways:
    - my-gateway
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: my-app-service
            subset: blue
          weight: 100
```

---

## üß™ Step: Canary Test (Optional)

```yaml
http:
  - route:
      - destination:
          host: my-app-service
          subset: green
        weight: 10
      - destination:
          host: my-app-service
          subset: blue
        weight: 90
```

Use **Grafana dashboards + Prometheus alerts** to monitor errors and latency.

---

## ‚úÖ Step: Full Cutover to Green

```yaml
http:
  - route:
      - destination:
          host: my-app-service
          subset: green
        weight: 100
```

---

## üõë Step: Rollback if Needed

Revert to Blue subset in `VirtualService`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Database Strategy

| Step                    | Action                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Pre-migration         | Apply schema changes that are backward compatible          |
| ‚úÖ Version-tolerant code | Both v1 and v2 must handle new/old fields gracefully       |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid                | Destructive changes like field deletion or column renaming |
| ‚úÖ Optional              | Use Flyway or Liquibase for versioned migrations           |

---

## üîç Monitoring (Production Readiness)

* ‚úÖ **Istio Telemetry** with **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
* ‚úÖ **Grafana** dashboards for real-time monitoring.
* ‚úÖ Set **alerts** for 5xx errors, latency spikes, etc.
* ‚úÖ **Health checks** via Istio probes.

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

| Stage         | Tool Example                 |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Build         | Jenkins / GitHub Actions     |
| Test          | JUnit + REST Assured         |
| Deploy Blue   | ArgoCD / Helm / GitOps       |
| Deploy Green  | Manual or ArgoCD stage       |
| Shift Traffic | GitOps PR or `kubectl apply` |
| Observe       | Grafana dashboards           |
| Rollback      | Revert VirtualService        |

---

## üìå Best Practices

* Use **separate logging** for Blue & Green (`version` label).
* Validate Green with **synthetic traffic** first.
* Keep Blue alive until Green is fully verified.
* Always **test rollback** before production deployments.
* Automate with **GitOps pipelines** (ArgoCD, Flux).

---

## ‚úÖ Interview Preparation for Blue-Green Deployment

### 1. **What is Blue-Green Deployment?**

* **Blue-Green Deployment** involves having two identical environments: one (Blue) that‚Äôs live, and the other (Green)
  that hosts the new version. When Green is validated, traffic is switched over.

### 2. **Why would you use Blue-Green Deployment?**

* It provides **zero downtime** during releases.
* It allows for **instant rollback** if something goes wrong with the new version.

### 3. **What is the challenge of Blue-Green in a production environment?**

* Managing **DB schema changes** while ensuring compatibility with both versions.
* Handling the **cost** of maintaining two full environments.
* **Monitoring and observability** are crucial to ensure the Green environment is stable before switching.

### 4. **How do you manage database migrations in Blue-Green?**

* The database schema must be **backward-compatible**. Any schema changes should not break Blue (v1).
* For major schema changes, **use versioning tools like Flyway** or **Liquibase**.

### 5. **How do you test the Green environment before switching?**

* **Canary tests** are a good approach: route a small portion of traffic to Green and monitor it for issues.
* Use **Istio‚Äôs observability tools** (like telemetry) along with **Prometheus/Grafana** to monitor performance, errors,
  and latency.

### 6. **What are the risks of Blue-Green Deployment?**

* **Stateful applications** might face issues since both Blue and Green must access the same database state.
* **Infrastructure cost** can be high due to maintaining two identical environments.

## üé§ Real-world Interview Questions

1. **What are the key differences between Blue-Green Deployment and Canary Deployment?**
2. **How would you handle schema changes between Blue and Green in a microservice architecture?**
3. **How does Istio assist in the Blue-Green deployment process?**
4. **Can you implement Blue-Green with CI/CD tools like Jenkins or ArgoCD? How?**
5. **How would you handle rollback if Green fails after 100% traffic has been routed to it?**
6. **What‚Äôs the difference between Blue-Green and Rolling Deployment?**

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Blue-Green Deployment is a powerful strategy for zero-downtime releases and fast rollback capabilities. With tools like
**Kubernetes**, **Istio**, and **CI/CD integration**, you can ensure a smooth and safe transition to new application
versions in production.

Always keep in mind:

* **Database compatibility** is critical.
* **Monitoring** is essential for a safe and smooth transition.
* **Automation** via CI/CD pipelines makes this process repeatable and error-free.
