# ðŸ§± Microservices Core Principles

Microservices architecture is guided by a set of **core principles** that help ensure services are **scalable**, *
*independent**, **resilient**, and **maintainable**. Here's a breakdown of the most important microservice principles
every developer and architect should know:

## ðŸ”‘ Core Principles of Microservices

| #  | Principle                              | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|----|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Single Responsibility**              | Each microservice should handle **one specific business capability**. This aligns with the **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** from SOLID.       |
| 2  | **Loose Coupling**                     | Microservices should interact **minimally and independently**. Changes in one service should not affect others.                                        |
| 3  | **High Cohesion**                      | Internal components of a service should be strongly related and focused on a **single purpose**.                                                       |
| 4  | **Autonomy**                           | Services should be **independently deployable, versioned, scaled, and managed**.                                                                       |
| 5  | **Bounded Context**                    | Each service owns a **bounded domain model**, following DDD (Domain-Driven Design). Avoid sharing databases or business logic across services.         |
| 6  | **Decentralized Data Management**      | Each service should manage its own database. No shared database among microservices to ensure isolation and flexibility.                               |
| 7  | **Failure Isolation**                  | Failures should be **contained** within a single service. Use patterns like **circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts** to prevent cascading failures. |
| 8  | **API Contract-based Communication**   | Services interact through well-defined **interfaces (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)**. Avoid tight coupling via shared code or internal method calls.            |
| 9  | **Observability**                      | Use logging, metrics, tracing, and health checks to monitor service behavior. Tools: **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Jaeger**.                             |
| 10 | **Security**                           | Each service must be secured individually using **OAuth2, JWT, mTLS**, and **zero trust principles**.                                                  |
| 11 | **Infrastructure Automation**          | CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes) are crucial for scalable microservice delivery.                             |
| 12 | **Polyglot Persistence & Development** | Freedom to choose different databases and languages based on service needs. Example: MongoDB for one service, PostgreSQL for another.                  |
| 13 | **Scalability**                        | Services can be **scaled independently** based on traffic and resource requirements.                                                                   |
| 14 | **Event-Driven Communication**         | Services should support **asynchronous communication** using message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or NATS.                                            |

## âœ… Bonus Best Practices

1. Prefer **stateless services** to ensure horizontal scalability.
2. Implement **Service Discovery** (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to auto-register and locate services.
3. Use an **API Gateway** (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong) to route, secure, and throttle APIs.
4. Implement **Rate Limiting, Load Balancing**, and **Caching** at the service level.
5. Follow **12-Factor App** principles for cloud-native readiness.
