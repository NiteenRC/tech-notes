# ðŸš€ The 12-Factor App Methodology

The [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) is a methodology for building modern, cloud-native applications that are *
*portable, scalable, resilient**, and **maintainable**. These principles are widely adopted in **microservices
architecture** to ensure best practices in development and operations.

## ðŸ§± The 12 Factors

| #  | Factor                  | Summary                                                                                     |
|----|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Codebase**            | One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys.                                      |
| 2  | **Dependencies**        | Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies (e.g., via `pom.xml`, `package.json`).          |
| 3  | **Config**              | Store config in the environment (e.g., `.env`, environment variables) â€” not in code.        |
| 4  | **Backing Services**    | Treat backing services (DB, message queues, etc.) as attached resources, accessed via URLs. |
| 5  | **Build, Release, Run** | Strictly separate the build, release, and run stages.                                       |
| 6  | **Processes**           | Execute the app as one or more **stateless** processes.                                     |
| 7  | **Port Binding**        | Export services via port binding (e.g., Spring Boot on port 8080).                          |
| 8  | **Concurrency**         | Scale out via process model â€” spin up more instances instead of making a monolith bigger.   |
| 9  | **Disposability**       | Fast startup and graceful shutdown for resilience and scaling.                              |
| 10 | **Dev/Prod Parity**     | Keep development, staging, and production as **similar** as possible.                       |
| 11 | **Logs**                | Treat logs as event streams â€” don't manage log files, stream them to a central system.      |
| 12 | **Admin Processes**     | Run one-off admin tasks as **isolated** processes (e.g., DB migrations).                    |

## âœ… Why It Matters for Microservices

- **Portability:** Works across cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **Consistency:** Simplifies CI/CD, containerization, and observability.
- **Resilience:** Supports failure recovery and quick scaling.
- **DevOps Friendly:** Enables smooth automation and infrastructure as code.

## ðŸ”§ Tools That Align with 12-Factor

- **Spring Boot** â€“ for port binding, environment config, and dependency management.
- **Docker + Kubernetes** â€“ for stateless process execution and disposability.
- **Vault or AWS Secrets Manager** â€“ for secure environment-based config.
- **Logstash + ELK / Fluentd + Grafana** â€“ for centralized logging.
- **Flyway / Liquibase** â€“ for one-off admin tasks like migrations.
