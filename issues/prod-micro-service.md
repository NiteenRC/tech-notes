# 🛠️ Practical Production Issue Tracing Without Realtime Tracing

A simplified, effective approach to trace and fix production issues in microservices **without** distributed tracing tools.

---

## ✅ 1. Start from the Symptom

- Gather from users or alerts:
    - What API or feature failed?
    - Error message or HTTP code
    - When it happened (timestamp)
    - Request payload (if available)

---

## 🔍 2. Identify the Entry Point

- Check logs of the **API Gateway** or frontend service.
- Use known request ID, user ID, or URL path to locate the first incoming request.
- Log entries typically show:
    - Source IP, path, headers, response time
    - Downstream service calls

---

## 📜 3. Trace via Logs (Service to Service)

- Move **service by service**, following the call chain.
- Use `requestId`, `userId`, or `timestamp` to search in centralized logs:
    - Kibana (ELK), Graylog, or even raw container logs (`kubectl logs`)
- Look for:
    - Errors or exceptions
    - Timeouts or retries
    - Unexpected return values

> 🧠 Tip: Ensure all services **log inbound and outbound requests** with basic identifiers.

---

## 📊 4. Correlate with Monitoring & Alerts

- Check metrics dashboards (Grafana, Datadog, Prometheus):
    - Spike in 5xx or 4xx errors?
    - Drop in throughput?
    - High CPU/memory or thread pool saturation?

---

## 🔁 5. Try Reproducing in Lower Environment

- Use the same request data and simulate the call flow.
- Helps confirm if the issue is:
    - Data-related
    - Env/config specific
    - Race condition or integration issue

---

## 🧠 6. Find Root Cause

- Check recent changes (code, infra, config).
- Validate database state (e.g., null data, missing joins).
- Review third-party dependency health.
- Use debug logs locally with breakpoints if needed.

---

## 🚀 7. Fix + Safely Deploy

- Prefer config/feature flag fix if possible.
- Test in staging, then use canary or gradual rollout.
- Watch logs and metrics for regression.

|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Logs        | Use `requestId`, `userId`, `serviceName`          |
| Error Logs  | Always include stack trace and request context    |
| Monitoring  | Add alerts on error rate, latency, DB timeouts    |
| Consistency | Use common log format across all microservices    |
