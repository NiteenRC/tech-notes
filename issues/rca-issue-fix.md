# 🛠️ Issue Identification and Resolution Process

A clear and professional approach to identify, analyze, and resolve reported issues.

---

## ✅ 1. Acknowledge & Understand the Issue
- Acknowledge the issue report and thank the reporter.
- Ask clarifying questions:
    - What were you doing?
    - What did you expect?
    - What actually happened?
- Review any provided evidence: logs, screenshots, stack traces, error messages, etc.

---

## 🔍 2. Reproduce the Issue (If Applicable)
- Attempt to recreate the issue in a local or staging environment.
- Use the same configuration, input, data, and user flow.
- If it’s not reproducible:
    - Ask for more specific steps.
    - Try reproducing in different environments or user conditions.

---

## 🧠 3. Root Cause Analysis
- Investigate using:
    - Logs
    - Monitoring dashboards
    - Code inspection and debugging tools
- Use tools like:
    - `git blame`, `git log` to check recent changes
    - The **5 Whys** or **Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram** for deep root cause analysis
- Isolate the module or component responsible.

---

## 🛠️ 4. Fix the Issue
- Implement a fix that addresses the root cause with minimal side effects.
- Follow coding best practices.
- Add or update unit/integration tests to cover the fix.
- Apply and test the fix in a **staging** environment.
- Conduct a **peer code review**.

---

## 🧪 5. Verify the Fix
- Test the original failing scenario.
- Confirm with the original reporter (if possible).
- Perform **regression testing** to ensure no side effects.

---

## 🚀 6. Deploy the Fix
- Use CI/CD pipelines for safe and automated deployment.
- Use:
    - Feature flags
    - Phased rollout
    - Canary releases (if needed)
- Monitor post-deployment health metrics and logs.

---

## 📝 7. Document the Issue and Fix
- Update the issue tracker (JIRA, GitHub Issues, etc.) with:
    - Root cause
    - Fix details
    - Follow-up actions
- Update internal documentation, SOPs, or runbooks if needed.

---

## 🔁 8. Prevent Future Recurrence
- Add:
    - Monitoring and alerting
    - Input validation or fallback mechanisms
    - Automated test cases
- Conduct a team post-mortem or knowledge-sharing session.
- Look for opportunities to automate the verification process.
