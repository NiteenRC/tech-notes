# File Upload with ExecutorService vs CompletableFuture

## Overview
This document compares two approaches to uploading files asynchronously in Java: **ExecutorService** and **CompletableFuture**. Both can be used for handling asynchronous file upload tasks, but they have different use cases, strengths, and trade-offs.

---

## ExecutorService Approach

### Use Case:
- Best for simple, isolated asynchronous tasks.
- Suitable when you don't need to chain multiple tasks or handle results after the upload completes.

### Pros:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement for straightforward use cases.
- **Manual Thread Management**: Provides full control over thread pool size and task scheduling.
- **No Overhead**: Low overhead if only performing one task.

### Cons:
- **No Built-in Task Chaining**: You have to manually manage task execution and subsequent actions.
- **Error Handling**: You need to handle errors manually (e.g., using `Future.get()` and catching exceptions).
- **Verbose for Complex Workflows**: Adding more tasks to be run after the upload (like retries or processing) requires more code.

### Example:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> uploadFile(filePath, serverUrl));
executor.shutdown();
```

## CompletableFuture Approach

### Use Case:
- Best for **complex asynchronous workflows** where multiple tasks need to be chained together.
- Ideal when you need to handle results, perform additional operations after the upload, or handle errors gracefully.

### Pros:
- **Cleaner and Readable**: Allows for chaining operations, making the code more concise and readable.
- **Built-in Error Handling**: Easy-to-use methods like `exceptionally()`, `handle()`, and `whenComplete()` for error handling.
- **Task Chaining**: You can easily chain multiple tasks (e.g., upload → process response → retry on failure) in a functional style.
- **Automatic Thread Management**: Handles thread pooling internally, so you don’t have to manage threads manually.

### Cons:
- **Overhead for Simple Use Cases**: Adds complexity when the task is simple and doesn’t require chaining.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of functional programming methods like `thenApply()`, `thenCompose()`, and `exceptionally()`.

### Example:
```java
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> uploadFile(filePath, serverUrl))
    .thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Upload complete"))
    .exceptionally(ex -> {
        System.err.println("Error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
        return null;
    });
```

## Key Differences

| Feature                         | **ExecutorService**                      | **CompletableFuture**                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Case**                     | Simple, isolated asynchronous tasks     | Complex, chained, or multiple async tasks      |
| **Error Handling**               | Manual error handling                    | Built-in error handling (`exceptionally()`)    |
| **Task Chaining**                | Not built-in, needs extra work           | Built-in chaining (`thenApply()`, `thenRun()`) |
| **Thread Management**            | Manual thread pool control               | Automatic thread management                    |
| **Code Readability**             | More verbose for complex workflows       | Cleaner and more readable                      |
| **Overhead**                     | Low overhead for single tasks            | More overhead for simple tasks                 |
| **Scalability**                  | Scales well with controlled thread pools  | Scales well with built-in task management      |

## When to Use Which

- **Use ExecutorService** when:
    - You need **simple asynchronous tasks** with minimal setup.
    - You don't need to chain tasks or handle results after the upload.
    - You want full control over **thread pool management**.

- **Use CompletableFuture** when:
    - You need **complex asynchronous workflows** with **chained tasks**.
    - You want to easily **handle results** and **errors**.
    - You need cleaner, more **maintainable code** with automatic thread management.

## Conclusion

Both **ExecutorService** and **CompletableFuture** are useful for file uploads, but the choice depends on the complexity of your application:

- For **basic file upload scenarios**, **ExecutorService** provides a straightforward solution.
- For more **advanced workflows** with task chaining, error handling, and scalability needs, **CompletableFuture** is the preferred choice.
