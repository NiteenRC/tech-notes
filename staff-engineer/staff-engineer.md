## 👋 Self Introduction

I’m **Niteen**, a results-driven Senior Lead Engineer with **11+ years of experience** in designing and delivering *
*high-performance, scalable, cloud-native systems**. My expertise spans **Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, Kafka, AWS,
Docker, Kubernetes**, and **system design principles**.

Currently, I’m a **Principal Engineer at Wissen Technology**, leading mission-critical applications in **healthcare,
e-commerce, and inventory management domains**. I specialize in **architecture modernization**, **microservice adoption
**, and **platform stability**.

## 🧠 My Role and Responsibilities

### 1. **Technical Leadership**

- Define architecture, review HLD/LLD, perform POCs, and drive technical decisions.
- Ensure alignment with **business goals** and **non-functional requirements (NFRs)**.

### 2. **Delivery Ownership**

- Own end-to-end delivery: sprint planning, execution, UAT, and production rollout.
- Proactively manage risks, dependencies, and blockers.

### 3. **Team Management**

- Mentor and guide a team of **4+ engineers** through 1:1s, code reviews, and career growth plans.
- Foster a culture of **collaboration, accountability, and continuous learning**.

### 4. **Cross-functional Collaboration**

- Act as a bridge between **development, QA, DevOps, product, and business stakeholders**.
- Drive alignment on priorities, trade-offs, and delivery timelines.

### 5. **Process Evangelist**

- Spearheaded initiatives like **shift-left testing**, **CI/CD automation**, and **incident response protocols**.

## ⚙️ Real-World Microservices Architecture

### **Key Highlights**

- **Architecture**: Domain-driven, modular microservices deployed on **AWS EKS (Kubernetes)** using **Helm**, secured
  via **OAuth2/JWT**, and managed with **CI/CD (Jenkins + ArgoCD)**.
- **Inter-service Communication**: REST (sync) and Kafka (async with retries, dead-letter topics).
- **Datastores**: PostgreSQL (OLTP), MongoDB (catalogs), Redis (caching), S3 (files), Kafka (event streaming).
- **Observability**: Full-stack monitoring with **Prometheus + Grafana (metrics)**, **ELK + Loki (logs)**, **Jaeger (
  tracing)**.
- **Security**: IAM, encryption (TLS in transit, KMS at rest), Vault for secrets, rate-limiting, WAF.

💡 **Impact**: Reduced deployment rollback issues by **70%** and improved release cycle time by **40%**.

---

## 🔍 Performance and Stability Challenges

### **Scenario**: Intermittent latency in production APIs

- Used **APM tools (Datadog)** and **Grafana metrics** to isolate DB bottlenecks and GC issues.
- Implemented **asynchronous processing** and **Redis caching**, reducing P99 latency from **3.2s → 800ms**.
- Added **alerts, health probes, and chaos tests** to proactively detect failures.

**Takeaway**: Performance optimization is a holistic effort across **code, architecture, runtime, and infrastructure**.

---

## 📐 HLD & LLD Approach

### **High-Level Design (HLD)**

- Define system boundaries, inter-service contracts, CAP trade-offs, and tech stack decisions.
- Align with NFRs like **availability, consistency, scalability, and throughput**.

### **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

- Focus on class responsibilities, design patterns, exception handling, threading models, and retry logic.
- Apply **SOLID, GRASP, DRY, and YAGNI** principles with UML diagrams and sequence flows.

---

## 🧑‍✈️ Incident Handling & Post-Mortem

### **When a bug is reported late**:

1. Deep-dive using **logs, traces, and access logs**.
2. Reconstruct data flow across microservices and state transitions.
3. Add missing tests and monitoring hooks to prevent recurrence.
4. Share learnings in **RCAs and blameless post-mortems**.

📈 **Philosophy**: Don’t just fix the symptom—improve the system.

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization Strategies

- Use **JMH benchmarking** and heap/GC tuning.
- Replace nested loops with **maps/sets** or streaming.
- Offload heavy operations to **Kafka queues**.
- Optimize queries with **pagination, projections, and connection pooling**.

---

## 🛠️ Day-to-Day Activities

- Drive daily stand-ups, unblock the team, and ensure sprint goals are met.
- Translate product epics into **technical plans and architecture**.
- Review PRs for **readability, extensibility, and fail-safety**.
- Mentor engineers on **system design, incident handling, and performance tuning**.

---

## ✅ Code Review Philosophy

- Ensure code is **secure, clean, testable, and observable**.
- Highlight **design flaws, performance anti-patterns, and test coverage gaps**.
- Promote **functional cohesion, immutability, and thread safety**.
- Emphasize **naming conventions** and **minimal side effects**.

📈 **Code reviews** are not just feedback—they’re how we scale engineering excellence.

---

## 🧩 Estimation and Sprint Management

- Break stories by **complexity, risk, and testing effort**.
- Use **T-shirt sizing** and **Fibonacci story points**.
- Prioritize with **MoSCoW** and **WSJF techniques**.
- Maintain a **20% buffer** for spikes, bugs, and blockers.

---

## 🚦 Change Management Mid-Sprint

- Accept **high-priority production bugs** immediately.
- Perform **impact analysis** for new features and groom the backlog.
- Use **Change Advisory Board (CAB)** for critical deployment approvals.

---

## 💬 Stakeholder Communication

- Provide weekly updates with **burndown charts, risk flags, and delivery forecasts**.
- Align with product managers on **trade-offs between time, scope, and quality**.
- Present metrics like **lead time, DORA stats, test pass %, uptime, and MTTR**.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People Management

### **Underperformers**

- Set clear KPIs (e.g., quality, ownership, estimation accuracy).
- Provide mentoring, reverse KT, and small wins to boost confidence.
- Escalate with data-backed PIP if no improvement is observed.

### **New Joiners**

- Create a **30-60-90 Day onboarding plan**.
- Conduct KT sessions, mock assignments, and buddy programs.
- Evaluate on **documentation, test writing, and feedback culture**.

### **Conflict Resolution**

- Use **1-on-1s** to understand root causes (misalignment, personality, scope).
- Clarify **roles, responsibilities, and shared goals**.
- Escalate only when **collaborative resolution** fails.

## 🧠 My Strengths

- **End-to-End Ownership**: From design to production support.
- **Bias for Action**: Prioritize unblocking and fast feedback.
- **Scale Thinking**: Build for 10x growth.
- **Mentorship & Collaboration**: Enable engineers, not just manage them.

---
