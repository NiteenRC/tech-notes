## ✅ Answer:

If I’m given the opportunity to gather requirements from stakeholders, I follow these steps:

### 1. 🎯 Understand Business Goals
- Discuss and clearly define the **business objectives** the stakeholders want to achieve.

### 2. 📝 Prepare a BRD (Business Requirements Document)
- Include:
    - **Functional Requirements (FR):** Features, operations, workflows, and data handling.
    - **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** Performance, security, scalability, and consistency.

### 3. 📤 Share and Review
- Share the BRD with stakeholders for **review and feedback** to ensure all points are captured correctly.

### 4. 🤝 Follow-Up Discussions
- Conduct follow-up sessions to **clarify ambiguities** and ensure a shared understanding of the scope.

### 5. ✅ Formal Sign-Off
- Get a **formal sign-off** before moving to the next phase to prevent misunderstandings later.

### 6. 📨 Meeting Notes
- Send **meeting summaries or MOMs** after each session to keep communication transparent.

### 7. 📊 Track and Update
- Use **JIRA** to track requirements and **Confluence** to document changes and decisions.

### 8. 🔄 Feedback Loop
- Regularly collect feedback to **ensure stakeholder needs are continuously met** as the project progresses.
