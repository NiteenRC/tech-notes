# 🔧 Low-Level Design (LLD) Process

## ❓ Question:
**How do you proceed with Low-Level Design (LLD) after completing HLD?**

---

## ✅ Answer:

Once the High-Level Design (HLD) is finalized and signed off, I proceed with Low-Level Design (LLD) using the following steps:

---

### 1. 📖 Understand the HLD in Depth
- Revisit the HLD document to:
    - Understand component responsibilities
    - Analyze module interactions
    - Review selected technologies and data flow

---

### 2. 🧩 Design Each Module in Detail
- Break down the system into **individual modules/services**.
- Define:
    - Classes and Interfaces
    - Public APIs and method signatures
    - Input/Output data structures
    - Internal processing logic

---

### 3. 🗃️ Define Class Diagrams
- Create UML Class Diagrams to capture:
    - Class relationships (Inheritance, Composition)
    - Attributes and methods
    - Interfaces and dependencies

**Tools:** StarUML, Lucidchart, PlantUML, Draw.io

---

### 4. 🔄 Sequence Diagrams / Flowcharts
- Design sequence diagrams to show:
    - Interaction flow between objects/components
    - Step-by-step logic execution
- Add flowcharts for complex decision-making or algorithms

---

### 5. 🗂️ Database Design (LLD-Level)
- Design normalized tables or document schemas.
- Define indexes, constraints, and data access patterns.
- Map entities to DB tables (ORM strategy if applicable)

---

### 6. 🧪 Exception Handling & Edge Cases
- Define how each component handles:
    - Exceptions and failures
    - Timeouts or retries
    - Fallbacks (e.g., circuit breakers)

---

### 7. 🔐 Security Considerations
- Incorporate detailed plans for:
    - Authentication & Authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth2)
    - Data validation & sanitization
    - Secure communication (HTTPS, encryption)

---

### 8. 🧪 Include Unit Test Plans
- Identify:
    - Testable components
    - Input/output scenarios
    - Mock dependencies

---

### 9. 📝 Create the LLD Document
Include:
- Class diagrams & flow diagrams
- Detailed module-level logic
- API contracts (URL, method, payload)
- Data models with field-level details
- Error handling strategy
- Security, performance notes
- Dependencies & configurations

---

### 10. 🤝 Review and Freeze
- Review LLD with:
    - Team leads
    - Architects
    - Developers
- Finalize before starting implementation.
