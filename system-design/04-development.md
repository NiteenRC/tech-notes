# 🚀 Post-Design Phase Checklist

## ❓ Question:
**What comes after Requirement Gathering, HLD, and LLD in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**

---

## ✅ Answer:

After completing the Requirement, High-Level Design (HLD), and Low-Level Design (LLD) phases, the next steps ensure successful delivery through development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

---

## 📋 Process Breakdown

---

### 1. 🧪 Test Strategy & Planning
- Define test strategy: Unit, Integration, System, UAT.
- Create test cases, data sets, and environment setup plans.
- Tools: **JUnit**, **TestNG**, **Postman**, **Selenium**, **JMeter**

---

### 2. 📅 Project Planning & Sprint Breakdown
- Convert LLD into **JIRA stories/tasks**.
- Prioritize based on business goals.
- Estimate and assign tasks to upcoming sprints.

---

### 3. 🛠️ Development Phase
- Set up dev environments and repositories.
- Start implementation using:
    - TDD/BDD (e.g., JUnit, Mockito, Cucumber)
    - SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
- Conduct regular **code reviews**.

---

### 4. ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Configure CI/CD for:
    - Build automation
    - Testing automation
    - Docker image generation
    - Deployment to dev/staging

**Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI

---

### 5. 🌐 Environment Provisioning
- Set up environments: Dev, QA, Staging, UAT, Production.
- Use **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Helm**, and **Terraform** if required.

---

### 6. 🔐 Security & Compliance
- Implement application security:
    - OAuth2, JWT, HTTPS, input validation
- Use static code analyzers like **SonarQube**.
- Ensure compliance: **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **PCI-DSS** (as applicable)

---

### 7. 📄 Documentation
- Finalize:
    - API Specs (**Swagger/OpenAPI**)
    - Developer & Ops Guides
    - Setup Instructions
    - Changelog & Release Notes

---

### 8. ✅ Testing & Quality Assurance
- Execute all test plans:
    - Unit Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - System Testing
    - Performance & Load Testing
    - Security & Vulnerability Testing
- Track and fix defects.

---

### 9. 🧪 UAT & Sign-Off
- Conduct **User Acceptance Testing** with business stakeholders.
- Incorporate feedback.
- Get **formal sign-off** for release readiness.

---

### 10. 🚀 Go-Live & Production Deployment
- Release application to production.
- Conduct smoke/sanity tests post-deployment.
- Prepare rollback plans in case of failures.

---

### 11. 📈 Monitoring & Post-Deployment Support
- Set up logging and monitoring:
    - **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK Stack**
- Define alerting rules and support SLAs.
- Provide L1/L2 support.

---

### 12. 🔄 Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
- Conduct sprint/project retrospective.
- Document:
    - What went well
    - What to improve
    - Lessons learned
- Feed insights into future projects.
