# Database Sharding, Partitioning, and Replication Overview

## 1. Sharding

**Definition:**  
Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple **independent databases** (shards) to handle large datasets
by splitting them horizontally.

**Use Case:**  
When data grows too large for a single server, sharding is used to **scale horizontally**.

**Types:**

- **Range-Based Sharding:** Splits data based on a specific range (e.g., date range, numerical values).
- **Hash-Based Sharding:** Distributes data uniformly based on a hash function.
- **Directory-Based Sharding:** Uses a lookup table to define how data is distributed across shards.

**Challenges:**

- **Cross-shard queries**: Hard to handle; may affect performance.
- **Data rebalancing**: Moving data between shards to ensure even load distribution.

**When to Use:**

- Large-scale applications with **high read/write volumes**.
- Distributed systems where data can be naturally divided (e.g., **user data**, **social media posts**).

## 2. Partitioning

**Definition:**  
Partitioning splits data into smaller, more manageable segments within a **single database instance**.

**Use Case:**  
To optimize performance for large datasets within a single server or database.

**Types:**

- **Range Partitioning:** Divides data based on a range (e.g., dates).
- **Hash Partitioning:** Divides data based on a hash function.
- **List Partitioning:** Based on predefined values (e.g., region-based data).

**Advantages:**

- Improved query performance.
- Easier to manage large datasets.

**When to Use:**

- Systems where scaling within a single database is enough (e.g., **OLTP systems**).

## 3. Replication

**Definition:**  
Replication involves copying data from a **primary database (master)** to one or more **secondary databases (replicas)**
for **high availability** and **read scalability**.

**Use Case:**  
When you need **data redundancy**, **high availability**, and to scale **read operations**.

**Types:**

- **Master-Slave Replication:** Primary database handles writes; replicas handle reads.
- **Master-Master Replication:** Multiple databases accept writes and replicate changes to each other.
- **Multi-Master Replication:** Involves more than two databases that replicate data among themselves.

**Challenges:**

- **Replication lag**: Delayed propagation of data to replicas.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring data is consistent across replicas (sync vs async replication).

**When to Use:**

- Applications needing **high availability** (e.g., **web apps**, **reporting systems**).
- Systems that need **read scalability** (e.g., content-heavy apps).

| **Purpose**           | Horizontal scaling by splitting data across multiple servers. | Optimizing data within a single database instance. | High availability and read scalability through copies of data. |
| **Scaling**           | Horizontal (across multiple servers).                         | Vertical (within a single instance).               | Read scalability (across replicas).                            |
| **Data Distribution** | Distributed across multiple servers.                          | Divided within a single database instance.         | Copied across multiple databases.                              |
| **Consistency**       | Complex (eventual consistency).                               | Easier consistency management.                     | Synchronous or asynchronous.                                   |
| **Use Case**          | Large-scale, distributed systems.                             | OLTP systems with large datasets.                  | High availability and fault tolerance.                         |

## **Key Considerations:**

- **Sharding** is best for **horizontal scaling** when dealing with very large datasets.
- **Partitioning** is used within **single databases** to improve performance.
- **Replication** is ideal for **read scalability** and ensuring **data redundancy** and **high availability**.
